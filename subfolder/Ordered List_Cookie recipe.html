        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1)</b> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place 1/2 cup sugar into a shallow bowl.
            <br />

            <b>Step 2) </b> Stir peanut butter, remaining 1 1/4 cup sugar, and eggs together in a mixing bowl until well
            combined. Roll into 36 small balls. <br />

            <b>Step 3) </b> Roll balls in reserved sugar until coated, then arrange 1 inch apart on ungreased baking
            sheets. <br />

            <b>Step 4) </b> Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned on the bottom and the edges are
            beginning to crack, 12 to 14 minutes. <br />

            <b>Step 5) </b> Remove from the oven and immediately press one chocolate kiss into the center of each
            cookie. Cool on the baking sheets for 1 to 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about
            15 minutes. <br />
